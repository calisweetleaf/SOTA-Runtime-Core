# Tools
Builtin tools:
- `web_search`

// Cite information from the tool using the following format:
// `【{cursor}†L{line_start}(-L{line_end})?】`

# Valid channels: analysis, commentary, final.
Calls to these tools must go to the commentary channel: 'functions'.

# Tools

## browser
// Web retrieval and navigation for time-sensitive or uncertain facts.
namespace browser {
type search = (_: {
  query: string,
  topn?: number,
}) => any;
type open = (_: {
  id?: number | string,
  cursor?: number,
  loc?: number,
  num_lines?: number,
}) => any;
type find = (_: {
  pattern: string,
  cursor?: number,
}) => any;
}

## python
// Use for private analysis and transformations only.
// Calls to python MUST go in the analysis channel.

## functions
// Calls to these tools must go to the commentary channel: 'functions'.

# Reference Appendix

Reference format:
- Use explicit channel headers.
- Keep tool invocation arguments valid JSON.
- Treat `analysis` as private reasoning and `final` as user-visible output.
- Keep citations adjacent to claims derived from tools.
